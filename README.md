## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the Deep Learning for Deep Learning course at the Polytechnic University of Madrid. The course is part of the Master in Data Science program.

## Installation
This project has the following python dependencies:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow
- Sci-kit Learn
- Rasterio

Before installing the dependencies, it is recommended to create a virtual environment. To create a virtual environment, run the following command:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Or in Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

To install the dependencies, run the following command:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
For the usage of the code, please refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the `CNN/FFNN/TransferLearning` folders.
